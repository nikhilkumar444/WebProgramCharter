A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase. A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points). Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
