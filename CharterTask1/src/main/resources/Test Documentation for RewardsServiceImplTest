Test Documentation for RewardsServiceImplTest
Overview
The RewardsServiceImplTest class contains unit tests for the RewardsServiceImpl class. These tests ensure that the rewards calculation logic and transaction processing are functioning correctly. The tests use JUnit 5 and Mockito to mock dependencies and verify the behavior of the service methods.

Prerequisites
JUnit 5: Ensure you have JUnit 5 as a dependency in your project for running the tests.
Mockito: Mockito is used for mocking the TransactionRepository and verifying interactions.
Spring Boot Test: The @SpringBootTest annotation is used to load the Spring application context for integration tests.
Test Methods
1. testGetRewardsByCustomerId()
Purpose: Test the getRewardsByCustomerId() method in the RewardsServiceImpl class. This method calculates the reward points for a given customer ID based on transactions from the last three months.

Mock TransactionRepository to return specific transactions for different time ranges.
Transactions used in this test are:
transaction1: $120, 30 days ago
transaction2: $80, 60 days ago
transaction3: $150, 90 days ago
Assertions:

Verify that the rewards calculated for the last month, the second-to-last month, and the third-to-last month are correct.
Expected rewards:
Last month: 40 points
Second month: 30 points
Third month: 100 points
Total: 170 points

2. testGetRewardsPerMonth()
Purpose: Test the getRewardsPerMonth() method in the RewardsServiceImpl class. This method calculates the reward points for a list of transactions for a given month.

Create mock transactions for the current month.
Transactions used:
transaction1: $120
transaction2: $80
Assertions:

Verify that the total rewards for the given transactions are correctly calculated.
Expected rewards: 90 points (20 * 2 + 30)

3. testCalculateRewards()
Purpose: Test the calculateRewards() method in the RewardsServiceImpl class. This method calculates the reward points for a single transaction based on the transaction amount.

Create mock transactions with varying amounts.
Transactions used:
transaction1: $120
transaction2: $80
transaction3: $45
Assertions:

Verify the reward points for each transaction based on the amount.
Expected rewards:
$120: 40 points (120 - 100) * 2
$80: 30 points (80 - 50)
$45: 0 points (below 50)

Running Tests
To run the tests:

Using Maven: Execute mvn test in the project directory.
